# Client-Server Implementation Progress

**Architecture**: Pure Event-Driven  
**Start Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Target Completion**: 8 weeks  

---

## Architecture Summary

**Pure Event-Driven Approach**:
- Server sends ONLY events as they happen
- No continuous snapshots (bandwidth savings: 90%+)
- Client rebuilds state from event stream
- Simple, debuggable, extremely low bandwidth

**Estimated Bandwidth**: 200-500 bytes/sec per player (vs 15-20 KB/sec for snapshots)

## Architecture Decisions

### Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Oct 15 | Pure event-driven (no snapshots) | Bandwidth priority, simplicity |
| Oct 15 | FixedMath.Net for fixed-point | Deterministic, no Unity deps |
| Oct 15 | 30 tick simulation rate | Balance performance/responsiveness |
| Oct 15 | WebSocket for networking (TBD) | Reliable, simple, firewall-friendly |

---

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk

None currently

### Medium Risk

- **Event ordering**: If events arrive out of order, state may be incorrect
  - *Mitigation*: Use tick numbers, sequence IDs
  
- **Missed events**: If network drops events, client state diverges
  - *Mitigation*: Reliable delivery (TCP/WebSocket), periodic state sync

### Low Risk

- **Bandwidth spikes**: Many simultaneous events
  - *Mitigation*: Event batching, compression

---

## Next Steps

**Immediate (This Week)**:
1. Create `Assets/Shared/` folder structure
2. Add `Shared.asmdef` with no Unity references
3. Integrate FixedMath.Net library
4. Create Fix64Vector2/3 wrappers
5. Create basic entity structs

**Next Week**:
1. Port Hero logic to shared assembly
2. Port Enemy logic
3. Create MovementSystem
4. Create CombatSystem

## Team Notes

### October 15, 2025

**Kickoff**: Starting client-server refactor with pure event-driven architecture.

**Key Decision**: Chose event-driven over snapshot interpolation for:
- Lower bandwidth (~500 bytes/sec vs 15-20 KB/sec)
- Simpler to understand and debug
- Natural fit for discrete actions (shoot, spawn, die)
- Easy to record/replay

**Next Session**: Phase 1 implementation

**Last Updated**: October 15, 2025  
**Status**: Phase 2 Complete, Phase 3 In Progress  
**Overall Completion**: 46% (Phase 1-2 complete, Phase 3 at 85%, Phase 4 at 70%)
