# Architecture Verification - Client-Server Separation

**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **VERIFIED CLEAN**

---

## ✅ Separation Verified

### Shared Assembly (Gameplay Logic)
All game simulation logic is deterministic and in `Assets/Shared/`:

**Systems (Gameplay Logic)**
- ✅ `MovementSystem.cs` - Entity movement, arena bounds
- ✅ `CombatSystem.cs` - Auto-shooting, collision detection, damage
- ✅ `AISystem.cs` - Enemy targeting, pathfinding
- ✅ `SpawnSystem.cs` - Entity creation

**Entities (Data Structs)**
- ✅ `Hero.cs` - Hero data (struct, not MonoBehaviour)
- ✅ `Enemy.cs` - Enemy data (struct, not MonoBehaviour)
- ✅ `Projectile.cs` - Projectile data (struct, not MonoBehaviour)
- ✅ `EntityId.cs` - Unique identifiers

**Math (Deterministic)**
- ✅ `Fix64.cs` - 16.16 fixed-point numbers
- ✅ `FixV2.cs` - 2D vectors
- ✅ `FixV3.cs` - 3D vectors

**Core**
- ✅ `Simulation.cs` - Main simulation loop
- ✅ `SimulationWorld.cs` - State management
- ✅ `CommandProcessor.cs` - Player commands
- ✅ `SimulationConfig.cs` - Constants

**Events & Commands**
- ✅ `SimulationEvents.cs` - All event definitions
- ✅ `SimulationCommands.cs` - Player choice commands

**Configuration Data**
- ✅ `HeroData.cs` - Hero stats
- ✅ `EnemyData.cs` - Enemy stats

---

### Client Assembly (Visualization Only)
All Unity visualization in `Assets/Scripts/Client/`:

**No Gameplay Logic Verified:**
```bash
grep "TakeDamage|\.Health\s*=|Physics\.|Rigidbody" Assets/Scripts/Client/
# Result: No matches found ✅
```

**Client Components (Read-Only)**
- ✅ `GameSimulation.cs` - Runs simulation, publishes events
- ✅ `EventBus.cs` - Event pub/sub system
- ✅ `EntityVisualizer.cs` - Creates/destroys GameObjects based on events
- ✅ `EntityView.cs` - Links GameObject to EntityId, reads simulation state
- ✅ `HealthBarController.cs` - Updates health bars from events
- ✅ `DamageNumberSpawner.cs` - Spawns damage numbers from events
- ✅ `CombatEffectsManager.cs` - VFX/audio from events
- ✅ `WaveManager.cs` - Enemy spawning (sends commands)
- ✅ `GameInitializer.cs` - Initial setup (sends commands)
- ✅ `UpgradeUIManager.cs` - UI (sends upgrade commands)
- ✅ `CameraController.cs` - Camera follows entities
- ✅ `SimulationDebugger.cs` - Debug UI
- ✅ `ConversionUtility.cs` - Type conversions
- ✅ `EntityRotation.cs` - Visual rotation
- ✅ `ProjectileTrail.cs` - Visual trails
- ✅ `GameSceneSetup.cs` - Scene setup helper

## ✅ Collision Detection Verification

### Old Architecture (DELETED):
```csharp
// Bullet.cs - DELETED ❌
void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other) {
    if (other.CompareTag(targetTag)) {
        Enemy enemy = other.GetComponent<Enemy>();
        enemy.TakeDamage(damage); // Physics-based
    }
}
```

### New Architecture (IN SIMULATION):
```csharp
// CombatSystem.cs - Line 87-143 ✅
public static void ProcessCollisions(SimulationWorld world)
{
    foreach (var projKvp in world.Projectiles) {
        foreach (var enemyKvp in world.Enemies) {
            Fix64 enemyRadius = Fix64.FromFloat(0.5f);
            Fix64 dist = FixV2.Distance(proj.Position, enemy.Position);
            
            if (dist <= enemyRadius) {
                enemy.TakeDamage(proj.Damage); // Deterministic
                world.UpdateEnemy(enemyKvp.Key, enemy);
                world.AddEvent(new EnemyDamagedEvent { ... });
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Result**: ✅ Collision detection is 100% deterministic in simulation

## 🗑️ Deleted Legacy Scripts

The following physics-based scripts have been **permanently deleted**:

1. ❌ `Bullet.cs` - Physics-based projectiles (Rigidbody, OnTriggerEnter)
2. ❌ `Hero.cs` - Physics-based hero (Health, Shooting, Physics.OverlapSphere)
3. ❌ `Enemy.cs` - Physics-based enemy (Health, Movement, Attack)
4. ❌ `GameManager.cs` - Old upgrade system
5. ❌ `EnemySpawner.cs` - Old spawning system
6. ❌ `LevelManager.cs` - Old level system
7. ❌ `CubeController.cs` - Old debug script

**Total deleted:** 7 scripts + meta files

## 🎮 How It Works Now

### Gameplay Flow (100% in Simulation)
```
1. Simulation.Tick() is called (30 times per second)
2. AISystem.UpdateEnemies() - Enemies target heroes
3. CombatSystem.ProcessHeroShooting() - Heroes auto-shoot
4. MovementSystem.UpdateAll() - Entities move (deterministic)
5. CombatSystem.ProcessCollisions() - Projectile hits (deterministic)
6. CombatSystem.ProcessEnemyAttacks() - Enemy melee attacks
7. World.Tick() advances tick counter
8. Events are collected and returned
```

### Visualization Flow (Client Only)
```
1. GameSimulation receives events from simulation
2. EventBus publishes events
3. EntityVisualizer subscribes to spawn/destroy events
   - Creates/destroys GameObjects
   - Updates positions from events
4. HealthBarController subscribes to damage events
   - Updates health bar fill
5. DamageNumberSpawner subscribes to damage events
   - Creates floating numbers
6. CombatEffectsManager subscribes to combat events
   - Plays VFX and audio
```

**Client never modifies simulation state!**

## 🔒 Guarantees

1. ✅ **No Unity Physics in Gameplay** - All collision is distance-based
2. ✅ **No MonoBehaviour in Entities** - Hero/Enemy/Projectile are structs
3. ✅ **Client is Read-Only** - Only reads state via EntityView
4. ✅ **Deterministic** - Fixed-point math, same inputs = same outputs
5. ✅ **Event-Driven** - All state changes generate events
6. ✅ **Command-Driven** - Player choices are commands
7. ✅ **Separated** - Shared assembly has noEngineReferences: true

---

## 📊 File Count

**Shared Assembly:**
- 25 files (simulation, entities, systems, math, events, commands)

**Client Assembly:**
- 16 files (visualization, UI, effects, debug)

**Config:**
- ConfigManager.cs (JSON loader)
- SceneLoader.cs (utility)

**Total:** 43 active files

---

## 🚀 Ready For

- ✅ Network synchronization (events already generated)
- ✅ Server build (.NET can run Shared assembly)
- ✅ Replay system (commands + tick = deterministic)
- ✅ Testing (simulation can run without Unity)

---

## 🎯 Key Achievement

**100% clean separation between simulation and visualization.**

The game now runs entirely from deterministic simulation code that:
- Has zero Unity dependencies
- Can run on a server
- Generates events for network sync
- Uses fixed-point math for consistency

The client is now a pure visualization layer that:
- Creates GameObjects based on events
- Updates visuals based on events
- Never modifies gameplay state
- Can be disconnected/reconnected without affecting simulation
